# Communication

There is a gitter channel [here](https://gitter.im/xasos/UIUC-Open-Data), channel `xasos/UIUC-Open-Data`. You're
welcome to drop in and ask questions, discuss bugs and such.

GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed
changes to this project.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues
are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused
on what we're actually doing, not wandering off into too much imaginary stuff.

# Frequently Asked Questions

 - Q: Why?<br>
   A: Many university applications and data sources are often of poor quality, so this API was created to alleviate some of those pains. This API allows students and faculty members to build applications on top, to take advantage of otherwise unused data.<br><br>
 - Q: Is this provisioned by the University of Illinois?<br>
   A: No, this API is not affiliated with UIUC in any way. It would be awesome if the university were to show interest and work with us, to further improve the quality of data provided.
